# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 3 of the MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration has been implemented. This phase focuses on migrating transactions and line items from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, implementing dual-write capabilities, and providing tools for verification and reconciliation.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Migration Scripts

#### `phase3_migrate_transactions.py`
Migrates raw transaction data from MongoDB collections to PostgreSQL:
- **Sources**: venmo_raw_data, splitwise_raw_data, stripe_raw_transaction_data, cash_raw_data
- **Features**:
  - Extracts transaction dates based on source type
  - Stores original MongoDB _id in `source_id` field
  - Preserves complete transaction data in `source_data` JSONB column
  - Idempotent (safe to re-run)
  - Built-in verification
  - Outputs transaction mapping file for line items migration

**Usage**:
```bash
cd server
python migrations/phase3_migrate_transactions.py
```

#### `phase3_migrate_line_items.py`
Migrates line items from MongoDB to PostgreSQL:
- **Features**:
  - Links line items to transactions via `transaction_id` foreign key
  - Stores original MongoDB _id in `mongo_id` column for ID coexistence
  - Looks up payment methods by name
  - Creates manual transactions for orphaned line items
  - Handles missing payment methods by creating "Unknown" payment method
  - Idempotent (safe to re-run)
  - Built-in verification

**Prerequisites**:
- Run `phase3_migrate_transactions.py` first
- Payment methods must be migrated (Phase 2)

**Usage**:
```bash
cd server
python migrations/phase3_migrate_line_items.py
```

### 2. Dual-Write Utility (`utils/dual_write.py`)

A robust dual-write utility for the migration period (Phases 3-5):

**Features**:
- Writes to MongoDB first (primary)
- Then writes to PostgreSQL (secondary)
- Non-blocking: PostgreSQL failures don't fail the operation
- Comprehensive error logging for reconciliation
- Supports critical mode for important operations

**Example Usage**:
```python
from utils.dual_write import dual_write_operation

result = dual_write_operation(
    mongo_write_func=lambda: insert(collection, data),
    pg_write_func=lambda db: create_pg_record(db, data),
    operation_name="venmo_transaction"
)
```

### 3. Verification Script (`phase3_verify.py`)

Comprehensive verification tool to ensure data consistency:

**Checks Performed**:
1. ✓ Transaction count verification (per source and total)
2. ✓ Line item count verification
3. ✓ Transaction spot checks (random sampling)
4. ✓ Line item spot checks (field-level validation)
5. ✓ Foreign key integrity
6. ✓ mongo_id uniqueness
7. ✓ Transaction date reasonableness

**Usage**:
```bash
cd server
python migrations/phase3_verify.py
```

**Output**:
- Detailed check results with ✓/✗ indicators
- Summary of passed/failed/warning checks
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure (suitable for CI/CD)

**Recommended Schedule**:
- After initial migration
- Periodically during dual-write period (e.g., hourly cron)
- Before switching reads to PostgreSQL (Phase 5)

### 4. Reconciliation Script (`phase3_reconcile.py`)

Automated reconciliation for dual-write failures:

**Features**:
- Finds records in MongoDB missing from PostgreSQL
- Syncs missing records to PostgreSQL
- Creates manual transactions for orphaned line items
- Dry-run mode for safety
- Detailed statistics and logging

**Usage**:
```bash
# Dry run (see what would be synced)
cd server
python migrations/phase3_reconcile.py --dry-run

# Actual reconciliation
python migrations/phase3_reconcile.py
```

**Recommended Schedule**:
- Run hourly as cron job during dual-write period (Phases 3-5)
- Run before verification checks
- Run before Phase 5 (switching reads to PostgreSQL)

**Cron Example**:
```bash
# Run every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/server && python migrations/phase3_reconcile.py >> /var/log/reconcile.log 2>&1
```

### 5. Unit Tests (`tests/test_phase3_migration.py`)

Comprehensive test suite covering:

**Test Classes**:
1. `TestDualWriteUtility`: Tests dual-write functions
   - Successful dual-write
   - MongoDB failure handling
   - PostgreSQL failure (critical and non-critical)

2. `TestTransactionMigration`: Tests transaction migration logic
   - Date extraction for all sources (Venmo, Splitwise, Stripe, Cash)
   - Transaction creation
   - Unique constraint enforcement

3. `TestLineItemMigration`: Tests line item migration
   - Line item creation
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Cascade delete behavior

4. `TestMigrationIntegration`: End-to-end tests
   - Complete Venmo migration flow
   - Orphaned line item handling

5. `TestPaymentMethodLookup`: Payment method tests
   - Lookup by name
   - Unknown payment method creation

**Run Tests**:
```bash
cd server
pytest tests/test_phase3_migration.py -v
```

## Data Model

### Transaction Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,           -- txn_xxx
    source ENUM(...) NOT NULL,              -- venmo, splitwise, stripe, cash, manual
    source_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,        -- MongoDB _id
    source_data JSONB NOT NULL,             -- Original transaction data
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    imported_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(source, source_id)
);
```

### LineItem Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE line_items (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,           -- li_xxx
    transaction_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,   -- FK to transactions
    mongo_id VARCHAR(24),                   -- Original MongoDB _id (for ID coexistence)
    date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    payment_method_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- FK to payment_methods
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    FOREIGN KEY (transaction_id) REFERENCES transactions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (payment_method_id) REFERENCES payment_methods(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

## Migration Workflow

### Initial Migration (One-Time)

1. **Backup MongoDB**:
   ```bash
   mongodump --db flask_db --out /backup/pre_phase3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
   ```

2. **Run Phase 2 (if not done)**:
   Ensure categories, payment methods, and tags are migrated.

3. **Migrate Transactions**:
   ```bash
   python migrations/phase3_migrate_transactions.py
   ```
   This creates `phase3_transaction_mapping.json` for line items.

4. **Migrate Line Items**:
   ```bash
   python migrations/phase3_migrate_line_items.py
   ```

5. **Verify Migration**:
   ```bash
   python migrations/phase3_verify.py
   ```
   All checks should pass before proceeding.

### Dual-Write Period (Active)

✅ **COMPLETED**: All refresh endpoints now use dual-write utility.

All refresh endpoints have been updated to write to both databases:
- ✅ Venmo: `refresh_venmo()` and `venmo_to_line_items()`
- ✅ Splitwise: `refresh_splitwise()` and `splitwise_to_line_items()`
- ✅ Stripe: `refresh_transactions_api()` and `stripe_to_line_items()`
- ✅ Cash: `create_cash_transaction_api()` and `cash_to_line_items()`

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# In resources/venmo.py (example)
from utils.dual_write import dual_write_operation

result = dual_write_operation(
    operation_name="venmo_refresh_transactions",
    mongo_write_func=lambda: bulk_upsert(venmo_raw_data_collection, transactions),
    pg_write_func=lambda: pg_bulk_upsert_transactions(transactions, "venmo")
)
```

**Testing**: All endpoints have dual-write unit tests (see `test_*_dual_write` classes)

### Reconciliation (Automated)

Set up cron job:
```bash
0 * * * * cd /path/to/server && python migrations/phase3_reconcile.py >> /var/log/phase3_reconcile.log 2>&1
```

### Verification (Periodic)

Run verification daily or before major changes:
```bash
python migrations/phase3_verify.py
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Transaction-First Approach
All line items must have a transaction. Orphaned line items get manual transactions created automatically.

**Why**: Maintains referential integrity and provides complete audit trail.

### 2. JSONB for Source Data
Original transaction data stored in `source_data` JSONB column.

**Why**:
- Complete audit trail
- Can query original data if needed
- No data loss during migration

### 3. mongo_id for ID Coexistence
Original MongoDB `_id` stored in `mongo_id` column on line_items.

**Why**:
- Allows API endpoints to accept both ID formats during transition
- Enables verification between databases
- Supports gradual frontend migration

### 4. Non-Blocking Dual-Write
PostgreSQL write failures don't fail the operation.

**Why**:
- MongoDB remains source of truth during migration
- No user-facing impact from PostgreSQL issues
- Reconciliation handles eventual consistency

### 5. Idempotent Scripts
All migration scripts can be safely re-run.

**Why**:
- Safe to retry on failures
- Easy to test
- Reduces risk during migration

## Phase 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 3 objectives have been achieved:
- ✅ Historical data migration complete
- ✅ Dual-write implemented for all refresh endpoints
- ✅ Verification passing (19/19 checks)
- ✅ Unit tests complete (16 dual-write tests added)
- ✅ Test isolation fixed (no production database pollution)
- ✅ `responsible_party` field added to line_items table

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

Now that Phase 3 is complete:

1. **Monitor Dual-Write Period** (Ongoing):
   - Review reconciliation logs regularly
   - Monitor PostgreSQL write success rate
   - Run verification script periodically: `python migrations/phase3_verify.py`
   - Set up automated reconciliation (cron job recommended)

2. **Phase 4 Preparation**:
   - Migrate events and tags (historical data)
   - Implement ID coexistence for events
   - Update event CRUD endpoints to dual-write
   - Begin read operation cutover planning

3. **Read Cutover** (Phase 4+):
   - Gradually switch read operations from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
   - Maintain dual-write for write operations
   - Monitor performance and data consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
1. Check MongoDB connection: `MONGO_URI` in `.env`
2. Check PostgreSQL connection: `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
3. Verify Phase 2 completed (payment methods exist)
4. Check logs for specific errors

### Verification Fails
1. Run reconciliation: `python migrations/phase3_reconcile.py`
2. Check for schema changes
3. Verify foreign key relationships
4. Review error logs

### Dual-Write Failures
1. Check `DUAL_WRITE_FAILURE` entries in logs
2. Run reconciliation script
3. Verify PostgreSQL connection and schema
4. Check for constraint violations

## Success Criteria

Phase 3 is considered complete when:

- ✅ All transactions migrated (counts match) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ All line items migrated (counts match) - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Verification script passes all checks - **COMPLETE (19/19 checks passing)**
- ✅ Foreign key integrity verified - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Spot checks show matching data - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Dual-write utility tested - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Reconciliation script tested - **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Unit tests written and passing - **COMPLETE (193 tests, including 16 dual-write tests)**
- ✅ Refresh endpoints use dual-write - **COMPLETE (Venmo, Splitwise, Stripe, Cash)**
- ✅ Test database isolation - **COMPLETE (SQLite in-memory for PostgreSQL tests)**

**Phase 3: ✅ COMPLETE**

## Recent Updates & Fixes

### November 2025: Schema & Test Fixes

**Problem**: Missing `responsible_party` field in PostgreSQL schema
- **Root Cause**: Field was being mapped to `notes` instead of having its own column
- **Fix**:
  - Added `responsible_party` column to `line_items` table
  - Created Alembic migration: `c967c3314f9f_add_responsible_party_column_to_line_items.py`
  - Updated `utils/pg_bulk_ops.py` to properly map the field
  - Migrated existing data from `notes` to `responsible_party`

**Problem**: Test data polluting production PostgreSQL database
- **Root Cause**: Tests used mongomock for MongoDB but production PostgreSQL
- **Fix**:
  - Modified `tests/conftest.py` to set `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///:memory:` before imports
  - Added PostgreSQL schema setup/teardown in test fixtures
  - All tests now use SQLite in-memory database for complete isolation
  - Production database no longer touched by tests

**Impact**: Verification now passes cleanly (19/19 checks)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check verification output for specific errors
2. Review reconciliation logs
3. Check PostgreSQL logs for constraint violations
4. Review MongoDB data for inconsistencies
